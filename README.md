## Leke Abolade

I am an engineering graduate that loves problem solving and want to become a software developer to create technology that positively impacts society. After completing an internship with my university’s psychology department, creating an iOS app that monitors cognitive decline, I discovered how I could help others using technology. 

Currently enrolled on Makers Academy, Europe’s leading web developer boot camp, aiming to develop self-learning capabilities to dive into any new technology stack.
