## Leke Abolade

I am an engineering graduate that loves problem solving and using technology to positively impact society. In just 12 weeks, I have learned and practiced fundamental principles of agile software craftsmanship. As I begin my journey as a software developer, I want to continue my high trajectory of learning and regularly contribute to the software community.

## Skills

#### Learning

- In the 10th week of my boot camp I completed my first hackathon over two days. Despite the pressure, I really enjoyed having the opportunity to learn from more senior developers.
- For my final project at my boot camp I decided to learn Swift to make a native iOS app. I had to also quickly adapt to using Xcode, a new development environment.
- In my nature as a tutor, I love to share my knowledge and teach others what I have learned. During the 7th week of my boot camp, I ran a short workshop on APIs to help my fellow cohort complete a [news summary app](https://github.com/aabolade/NewsSummaryApp)
- Additionally I am signed up as a mentor at [codebar](https://codebar.io/), and recently coached a student in basic HTML and CSS.

#### Communication and Teamwork

- 60 days of pair programming working on a variety of exercises to learn Object Orientated Design, Front end technologies, databases, JavaScript and Ruby on Rails.
- Use diagramming to explain my ideas and technical concepts to another person. This helps me communicate better and also allows others to mesh their ideas and suggestions without a verbal contest.
- Religiously practice agile principles, standups, retros, code reviews.
- I have experience of working internationally (Hong Kong and Japan) where being out of my comfort zone I was able to learn how to work with new settings and people.

#### Software design

- Abide by Agile and Test Driven Development (TDD) so designs are simple and code is only added to meet specific requirements.
- Understand and practice good software design patterns such as Model-View-Controller(MVC).

#### Dedication

- Completed 200-mile cycle from London to Paris for Charity Action Against Hunger. Initial fundraising target of £1,000 but this was exceeded to £3961.84 in 3 months (2014).

## Education

#### Makers Academy (October 2016 to present)

- Programming Fundamentals: OOD, SOLID, MVC, TDD

- Heroku and version control (Git)
- Regular debugging exercises

#### St Catherine's College, University of Oxford (October 2011 to June 2015)

- MEng Engineering Science (Hons), Power Electronics, Machine Vision, Automotive Engineering, Hydraulics, Renewable Energy.
- [Independent academic project](http://www.slideshare.net/LekeAbolade/4yp-exhibition-posterfinal) for Ricardo UK Ltd: investigated the replacement of a dual mass flywheel with a clutch in micro-slip. Used Matlab and Simulink to develop mechanical driveline model for analysis of torsional oscillation.
- Awarded National Grid In2Energy Scholarship (2012).
- Oxford University Amateur Boxing Club, OUABC (2013 - 2015).

## Experience
